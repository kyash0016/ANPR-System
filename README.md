# ANPR-System
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a highly accurate system capable of reading vehicle number plates without human intervention.
Through the use of high speed image capture with supporting illumination, detection of characters within the images provided, verification of the character sequences as being those from a vehicle license plate, character recognition to convert image to text; so ending up with a set of metadata that identifies an image containing a vehicle license plate and the associated decoded text of that plate.
This project uses OPEN CV and Easy OCR for image detection and character recognition from the license plate.
